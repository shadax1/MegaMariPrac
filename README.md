# MegaMariPrac
Speedrun practice tool for MegaMari. This project is heavily based off mpu's [RKS/F practice tool](https://github.com/mpumpu/rkshacks/releases).

## How to use
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/shadax1/MegaMariPrac/releases) and add the .exe file into your MegaMari game folder. Start the game followed by the practice tool and you will be good to go.

**Note:** the practice tool only works with the Japanese version of the game. It should be the one named `megamari.exe`.

## Known issues
+ loading save states may sometimes make the character slowly zip into the ground
+ the following hotkeys are not working as expected yet and will (hopefully) be fixed in version 1.0:
	+ load next stage
	+ load next save state

## Ideas/Improvements
+ make it so it selects `Continue` automatically when warping to another stage
+ have buttons for previous and next screen
+ faster win sequence
